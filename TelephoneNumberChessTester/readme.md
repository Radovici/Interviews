# Dynamic Chess Engine for Financial Asset Management Interview

## Overview
This repository contains a dynamic chess engine developed as part of a take-home programming interview for a position at a financial alternative asset manager. The engine is designed with extensibility and flexibility in mind, using a JSON configuration to dynamically define chess pieces, board layouts, and moves. This approach allows for adjustments to the game setup at runtime without the need to alter the code or restart the application.

## Original Instructions
The original PDF with detailed instructions and guidelines for this project can be found [here](./Chess.pdf).

## Features
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Chess board, pieces, and game moves can be configured dynamically using a JSON file. This makes the system adaptable and extensible to other types of games and scenarios.
- **Extensible Design:** The design supports various game types, board sizes, and piece types, enabling easy expansion and customization.
- **Test Console Application:** Includes a console application for testing the functionality of the chess engine.

## Results
The engine calculates the number of possible telephone numbers per chess piece based on their movements across the board:
- Pawn: 0
- Rook: 5034
- Knight: 952
- Bishop: 864
- Queen: 135495
- King: 124908
- Eldar (Custom Piece): 120

## Disclaimer
Please note that the numerical results generated by this engine have not been independently verified for accuracy. While the engine has been tested using the accompanying console application, it does not include unit tests.

## Usage
Instructions on how to configure and use the chess engine are included in the JSON configuration file within this repository. Users can modify this file to test different configurations and scenarios without altering the core application.
